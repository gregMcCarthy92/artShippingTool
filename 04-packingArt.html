                    Don't make this hard on yourself. Just watch some youtube videos. There are a few best practices it seems everyone ignores, like wearing gloves, but for both of these, I've seen worse out in the wild.

                    You'll probably also notice that everyone here has a nice studio, or a woodshop. Must be nice right? If you're broke, just have a sheet of plywood you can put on milk crates and cover in a shipping blanket. You can lean it up against the wall when you aren't using it and you can put stuff in the milkcrates. Proper tables are nice, but lets not assume you've got any money just because a gallery is paying attention to you. Broke is kind of the default in the arts...

                    This guy is okay at this. Itl will get you through, but he isn't exactly doing a great job. Notice the lack of gloves and the sketchy "FRAGILE" written on the front with a sharpie.

                    There are about a thousand different ways to do this and everyone has a prefference. As far as "right" ways go, this guy isn't it. However, it is a decent enough job that It will probably hold up to Canada Post if it is staying within the country. Idealy you'd want to send it a different way than the mail — unless you have never known fear or disappointment — but sometimes you just kind of have to do what you have to do. If you want the most correct answer to how to do this, check out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/wrapping-painting.html" id="bodyLink" target="_blank">this page</a> from the Canadian government.

                    This guy is great, if not a little obesessive. You can proabbly cut some corners safely with a bit more foam and hot glue and get it there about %90 as safe.

                    Just don't build your own crate unless you have a woodshop at your studio. Just don't. It seems like a good idea at the time. "I'll save some money" "I'm pretty handy" "Maybe my friend will let me borrow their table saw..."

                    It is never worth the hassle. It never is. Just pay someone. Eat Mr Noodles for a week, get a gig doing some landscaping, pawn something, sell your stuff on the internet, whatever it is, it is worth it. It is NEVER worth doing this without proper tools. If you have tools, <a href="https://app.pch.gc.ca/application/padcad/c1.app?lang=en" id="bodyLink" target="_blank">this</a> makes it easier, but if whatever you're doing needs a crate build on premesis for it, there are not preper tools, AND it can't be moved out safely with out one... You probably shouldn't have done it there in the first place.

                    If the skater looking guy had just rolled the glassine around the core once before rolling the artwork he could have avoided that medd with the tape and made the reciever's life significantly easier. Also, for the internal core, masking tape is way easier for your client. Shipping tape is nice, but the aggresive adhesive is a pretty sketchy thing to put that close to your works on paper.

                <p class="bP">
                    There is a pretty good chance that any Staples or photolab will be willing to give you a paper core or two to use as the internal core on a mailing tube. Cardboard outer cores are a little harder to come by but 4" PVC tubing from Home Depot is a really reliable and somewhar affordable option. The only thing to keep in mind is that the PVC will be dirty on the inside, give it a wipe down with some water and a paper towel on the interior and you should be good to go. Also shove some etha foam or bubble wrap in the ends before you get the caps on. It will really limit the amount of jostling that your work will go through while in transit.
                </p>
                <p class="bPIndent">
                    Keep in mind there is no surefire way to keep a tube safe. I've seen 1/4" carboard tubes bent in half and run over by trucks and I once got a photo back from the phillipines of a roll of prints in a PVC tube that was not obly smashed but showed signs of fire/smoke damage (fedEx tried to get out of this claiming it was shipped like that!). The world hates tubes in the mail. Be warned.
