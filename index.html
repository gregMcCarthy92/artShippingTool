                            Congratulations! You’ve just secured your first show outside of your home city. Great job! The only problem is now that you’ve created whatever it is that will undoubtedly change the future of the art world, you now have to get it to the gallery in one piece, and on time... and professionally enough that they might actually want to work with you again. 
                        </p>

                            Who knows if the show goes well you might even get represented by them, and you can quit that second job that pays for your studio. Right? Yup, you’re about to add “Toronto / New York based artist” to that bio on your website. Watch out world This is what all the time in the studio has been for! But wait, shit. I don’t think those paintings will fit in your friend’s Kia Rio and I don’t think blue-chip artists wrap their paintings up in bedsheets… I think you might need help with this.

                            This is how chat GPT imagines the process. We see the artist trying to put a painting that “doesn’t look that big” into a Dodge Caravan. These vehicles are widely believed to fit all objects made by humankind. We will be working over the next several steps to dispel these illusions.

                            Rest assured, you’re not the first one to come across this. Countless people before you have had this problem. They’ve graduated with a BFA or an MFA and have been educated to the nines about how to create interesting and thought-provoking art, but are struggling with the fact they have never been prepared for the fact that like it or not, their anticapitalist musings on the history of photography and culture, are about to run up against the cruel world of running a small business. This is fine, but We’ll have to prepare you to deal with this absolute bummer of a reality.
